                  <p>Goethe, in The sufferings of young Werther and Kant in his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,
                     have quite strong contrasting views on the role of desires in how to live one’s life properly.
                     Goethe believes that the pursuit of desires should be the focus of one’s life while Kant believes
                     that one should avoid pursuing desires. This contrast can be evident from their different opinions
                     on the rationality of pursuing desires and the moral value of desires. For rationality of pursuing
                     desires, Goethe would argue that desires can direct and motivate one’s life whereas Kant would say
                     that desires will govern and restrain one’s life; for the moral value of desires, Goethe would
                     support that desires can be moral as opposites to Kant who would argue that desires have no moral
                     worth. The distinction between the two authors’ ideas on desires is a good demonstration of the
                     difference between the Enlightenment period which focuses on reasoning and Romanticism which
                     concerned more about personal feelings.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The rationality of pursuing desires highlights a lot about the role of desires in how to live one’s
                     life properly. Goethe supports the pursuit of desires in one’s life because they can bring
                     motivation and direction for one’s life, whereas Kant argues that desires will restrain and govern
                     one’s life. In The sufferings of young Werther, Werther, knowing Lotte is married, tries to stop
                     his crush on her. He decides to move away so that he will not see her as often. He tries to make
                     himself busy in this new town, but all the new things here only make him miss her more. In his
                     letter, he writes “The leaven that used to set my life in motion is missing; the charm that kept me
                     spirits up in the depths of the light, that woke me from my sleep in the morning is gone” (Goethe,
                     The sufferings of young Werther, pg.58) Moving away from Lotte only makes Werther’s life more
                     miserable. He doesn’t have spirits or energy to do anything, and he loses the motivation of his
                     life. Knowing he cannot continue pursuing his dream, his hope in life is gone. When he realizes the
                     fact that Lotte is already married, he simply wants to make friends with her. He desires to be able
                     to see her and talk to her every day. And when he learns these can not come true, he loses the
                     motivation in continuing his life. Werther’s desires bring him not only happiness but also the hope
                     to live a life. When he has nothing to expect, he gets lost. By showing the importance of desires
                     in Werther’s life, it is evident that Goethe argues that it is rational for a person to pursue
                     desires, and desires should become the focus in one’s life. Kant shares a contrasting view on this
                     topic. He argues that desires will limit and govern one’s life, therefore one should avoid desires
                     in his/her life. In his discussion about the natural constitution of a person, he thinks that if
                     people live for preservation, he/she may come up with all kinds of reasoning to reach his/her goal.
                     But Kant thinks that reasoning should not determine whether an action should be taken, especially
                     “not to submit its faculty of desire to that weak and deceptive guidance and meddle with nature’s
                     purpose”(Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, 4:396)Here, “faculty of desire” means
                     ability or capacity. Kant is saying that reasoning is not a good way to determine whether an action
                     should be taken, because a person’s desire can be “weak and deceptive guidance” for actions. Kant
                     argues that when people have desires, they tend to act purposely. Their actions are guided by the
                     narrow reasoning from their desires and these reasons can interfere with the purpose of nature.
                     One’s actions will be restrained if he/she focuses on pursuing desires. The guidance given by one’s
                     desires is limited. Rather than being guidance, it provides more limits to people’s decisions. It
                     governs a person’s mind and action, and will become a form of imprisonment for one’s life. The
                     beliefs on the rationality of pursuing desires are held differ between Goethe and Kant. Goethe
                     supports the pursuit of desires since it is a rational act that brings motivation and hopes,
                     whereas Kant shares the opposite view with concern that desires will control and restrain one’s
                     life. Goethe, being an author during the Romanticism period, focused more on personal feelings
                     whereas Kant who lived in the era of Enlightenment and focused more on reasoning.

                  <p>
                     Besides the rationality of pursuing desires, Goethe and Kant also have opposite views on the value
                     of desires. Gothe would say that desires can have moral values as opposed to Kant who thinks that
                     desires have no moral worth. In The sufferings of young Werther, Werther falls in love with Lotte
                     when he first meets her. After learning that she is married, Werther tries different ways to stop
                     liking her, but all fail. When hearing from Lotte that she will not be seeing him anymore, Werther
                     commits suicide and he writes “It is not despair, it is the certainty that I have borne my
                     suffering to the end and am sacrificing myself to you. Yes, Lotte! Why should I keep silent? One of
                     the three of us must go, and I want to be the one!”(Goethe, pg128) In other words, Werther’s
                     suicide is not because of despair, but sacrificing himself for his relationship with Lotte. Even
                     though Werther wants to be with Lotte, he knows he can’t. He knows it is not right to fall in love
                     with a married lady, and he puts effort not to express his feelings for her. He doesn’t want to
                     break Lotte’s relationship with her husband. He knows from the beginning that one of them has to
                     leave and it should be him. Even though he has the desire to be with Lotte, he still chooses to do
                     the moral thing. His desire and his love for Lotte force him to make the right decision, which is
                     to sacrifice himself. Having desires doesn’t mean one will act immorally for their goals, desires
                     don't conflict with morality. Rather, desires can have moral values. Kant shares a contrasting view
                     with Goethe. In Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant introduced the concept of duty. He
                     argues that people should act from duty which he thinks as containing good will, not in conformity
                     with duty. He then provides an example that “to be beneficent where one can is a duty...but I
                     assert that in such a case an action of this kind, however it may conform with duty and however
                     amiable it may be, has nevertheless no true moral worth but is on the same footing with other
                     inclinations, for example, the inclination to honor, which, if it fortunately lights upon what is
                     in fact in the common interest and in conformity with duty and hence honorable, deserves praise and
                     encouragement but not esteem” (Kant, 4:398) Here, Kant first talks about how an action conforms to
                     duty can have no true moral worth, and then it leads to the discussion of personal inclination
                     which Kant also argues as having no moral worth. He uses the desire to honor as an example and
                     argues that the action may deserve praise and encouragement, but it contains no moral worth. People
                     pursuing desires can have positive effects, but it contains no moral value. Instead, people should
                     act from duty. When people act from desires, they are doing what they want, and when people act
                     from duty, they are doing what is right. Therefore Kant thinks that desires have no moral value.
                     Goethe believes that desires have moral value whereas Kant thinks focusing on desires in one’s life
                     doesn’t have moral worth. The difference of ideas between Enlightenment and Romanticism is also
                     demonstrated given the different approaches by two authors on discussing the moral value of
                     desires.

                  <p>
                     With regard to Goethe’s argument on the rationality of pursuing desires in one’s life, some may
                     argue that instead of directing one’s life, pursuing desires can actually cause more miseries in
                     one’s life. In Werther’s letter on June 21, he is really happy to meet with Lotte and he describes
                     a lot about the landscape and views around where he lives in the letter “It is marvelous how I came
                     here and gazed down from the hills into the beautiful valley...When we rush to be there, when there
                     becomes here, everything is as it was before, and we stand there as poor and limited as before, and
                     our soul craves the balm that has slipped away”(Goethe, pg44). He uses a metaphor here, and
                     represents the future as the view that is far away. “When there becomes here” means that when one’s
                     desires come true. Some might argue that here Goethe is saying that even though one’s desires are
                     achieved, his/her life doesn’t really change, and everything is like before. Desires can’t really
                     direct one’s life, rather, people are still poor and limited. Desires can only bring a false
                     illusion of motivation and hope, and they can’t really help in living one’s life properly. However,
                     this quote can be interpreted differently given the constraints of the society that Werther lives
                     in. Rather than bringing miseries, the quote is actually suggesting that the desires people pursue
                     may not be achieved given the social constraints at that time. There were different social groups,
                     and people had little freedom. It’s hard to reach their desires, especially for those from the
                     lower classes. Instead of showing the miseries desires can bring, the quote is actually critiquing
                     the society that Werther lives in. As Werther talks about it in one of his letters “what irritates
                     me most are the disastrous social conditions...they should not stand in my way just where I might
                     still savor a little joy, a glimmer of happiness on earth.”(Goethe, pg83) Goethe is critical of the
                     social conditions during Werther’s times, and he thinks that it restricts people and prevents them
                     from getting better. Goethe supports the pursuit of desires in living one’s life properly and he
                     critiques the social conditions that prevent people from fulfilling their desires.

                  <p>
                     Goethe and Kant have contrasting views on the role of desire in how to live one’s life properly.
                     The contrast can be demonstrated through their opposing views on the rationality of pursuing
                     desires and the moral value of desires. Goethe supports the idea of pursuing desires because it
                     brings people motivation and hope, and it contains moral values, whereas Kant suggests avoiding
                     desires since it can limit and control one’s life and have no moral worth. Goethe, being an author
                     from the Romanticism period, concerns more with personal feelings and emotions while Kant, who
                     lived during the Enlightenment period, focused mainly on using reasons for explanations. The
                     contrasting views between the two authors provide a clear distinction of the worldviews between
                     these two periods of time.
