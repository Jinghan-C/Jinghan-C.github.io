                  <p>The greatest obstacle that humans face in the search for knowledge, according to Montaigne and
                     Bacon, is the desire for certainty. People are so conservative that they reject uncertainties.
                     People tend to make judgments based on their own beliefs and opinions and this way of thinking
                     restricts the knowledge people have. The desire for certainty becomes a hindrance to humans’ search
                     of knowledge because it can lead to a life of denial and ignorance, it lowers people’s awareness
                     for false knowledge and it makes their ideas antiquated. By discussing the problem of desiring
                     certainties, Montaigne and Bacon both bring up the idea of skepticism which is a new method of
                     assessing the nature of knowledge.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Montaigne and Bacon both agree that the desire for certainty is a major obstacle that humans face
                     in the search for knowledge because it leads to a life full of denial and ignorance. People desire
                     certainty because they are used to staying in their comfort zone and having everything under
                     control. They deny anything they are uncertain about. In To Philosophize is to learn how to die,
                     Montaigne discusses that people should be ready to face death instead of worrying about it all the
                     time. However, for most people “the remedy is not to think about it; but what brutish insensitivity
                     can produce so gross a blindness?” (Montaigne, To Philosophize is to learn how to die, 20).
                     Montaigne calls those who are afraid to face death as blindness. People avoid thinking about death
                     because their knowledge about death is uncertain. They are afraid of death because they can’t
                     control it. But ignoring death doesn’t solve the problem. The rejection of learning death due to
                     its uncertainty only makes people more ignorant and causes more problems. Instead of avoiding the
                     problem, Montaigne argues that people should face it and fight against it: “let us deprive death of
                     its strangeness; let us frequent it, let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind
                     than death.”(Montaigne,24). People should face and accept uncertainty rather than avoiding it. It
                     is the acceptance that solves the problem, not denial. Similarly, Bacon argues the same idea in New
                     Organon. He talks about the problem of how people understand knowledge. People tend to believe in
                     what they are certain about and what they considered as right. For those contrary ideas, they
                     “either neglect and despise, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects, in order that by
                     this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusion may remain
                     inviolate”(Bacon, New Organon, 46). Once people adopt an idea they are certain about, they tend to
                     deny everything that is opposed to it. They don’t want to be proved wrong nor to be challenged by
                     the knowledge they have. They reject other information which “indeed, in the establishment of any
                     true axiom, the negative instance is more forcible of the two”(Bacon, 46). Bacon argues that the
                     desire for certainty limits people’s thoughts. By not being skeptical, people may miss the truth.
                     The desire for certainty and rejection of other ideas makes people ignorant. Bacon and Montaigne
                     both discuss the problem of people expecting certainty. The knowledge they have is limited by their
                     desire for certainty. They both agree that it can cause denial and ignorance in people’s lives, and
                     becomes an obstacle for people to learn knowledge.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The desire for certainty also lowers people’s awareness of false knowledge, which can be an
                     important hindrance in people’s search for knowledge. People desire certainty, so they tend to
                     agree on something that matches their beliefs without testing it, and deny any new knowledge that
                     they are uncertain about. It is likely for people to get false knowledge when they reject anything
                     new and not being skeptical about their knowledge. In the Essays, Montaigne brings up the example
                     of a guy’s first time seeing a river: “the first time he did so took it for the ocean, since we
                     think that the biggest things that we know represent the limits of what Nature can produce in that
                     species.”(Montaigne, That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own
                     capacities,75). The guy is making a judgment based on his limited knowledge and the conclusion he
                     comes up with is obviously wrong. Montaigne argues that people are likely to come up with false
                     conclusions because they don’t test their knowledge. People are not skeptical because it leads to
                     uncertainty. Once they start questioning, there will be uncertainties. So people prefer to just be
                     satisfied with the knowledge they have, even if the information they have is wrong. Reject
                     uncertainties lowers their awareness of false knowledge. Montaigne suggested that “if we cannot be
                     convinced we should at least remain in suspense”(Montaigne, 76) He thinks that if people cannot
                     agree with the contrary side, they should at least be questioning the knowledge. Bacon, agreeing
                     with Montaigne, argues for the same idea: “Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and
                     take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider”(Bacon, of studies)
                     Bacon suggested that accepting uncertainties is not to confute any idea, but to test and reconsider
                     their idea. People should be testing and reflecting since it is human nature to have false
                     judgment: “The Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or
                     race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things”(Bacon, New
                     Organon, 41) Bacon thinks that people tend to judge based on their own knowledge. It is something
                     humans are born with and it can lead to some false ideas or knowledge. Humans should test their
                     knowledge and seek the truth because this false assertion can lead to false information. It
                     increases the possibility for people to learn false knowledge when they aren't questioning. In
                     Montaigne and Bacon’s work, the idea of skepticism is discussed in contrast to humans’ desire for
                     certainty. Both of them present evidence that the result of rejecting skepticism is biased
                     judgments and less awareness of false knowledge. They conclude that people’s desire for certainty
                     is a major obstacle on the path of seeking knowledge because it lowers people’s awareness of false
                     knowledge.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Besides, both Montaigne and Bacon agree that humans’ desire for certainty can be a hindrance to the
                     search of knowledge for humans because it keeps their minds antiquated. According to Montaigne and
                     Bacon, people prefer conventions over innovations. It is easy for humans to feel satisfied and it
                     keeps them from discovering new knowledge. People like to live in a world where everything is
                     certain and they don’t have to question anything. However, it makes them ignorant and makes them
                     lag behind reality. Montaigne demonstrating the idea that “If we do not keep them busy with some
                     particular subject which can serve as a bridle to reign them in , they charge ungovernable about,
                     ranging to and fro over the wastelands of our thoughts”(Montaigne, on idleness, 9) Montaigne uses
                     himself as an example to argue that idleness is not something people should pursue. Instead, people
                     should be constantly thinking and questioning, otherwise, they will get lost. People who desire
                     certainty are like people who live in idleness. Their minds are left idle as Montaigne described.
                     Reject uncertainties prevent people from discovering new information which ultimately separates
                     people from social reality. Therefore, Montaigne implies that in order to keep up with social
                     development, people have to be skeptical and test their knowledge. Bacon, by the same token, also
                     presents evidence that the desire for certainty leads to antiquated ideas. Bacon uses medicine as
                     an example and talks about “surely every medicine is an innovation, and he that will not apply new
                     remedies must expect new evils; for time is the great innovator”(Bacon, of innovation) Bacon
                     describes medicine to patients as knowledge to humans. If people don’t learn new knowledge, their
                     ideas will be antiquated since everything else is developing. When people reject uncertainties,
                     they are rejecting progress and improvements. People who desire certainties will not be able to
                     have innovations. Bacon and Montaigne both argue that desire for certainty restricts people’s
                     knowledge which will eventually keep their ideas antiquated and make people lag behind society.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                     While it appears that desire for certainty can lead to a life full of denial and ignorance, some
                     might argue that certainty does not cause ignorance since having certainty in God can lead to the
                     discovery of truth which indicates that having certainty may not be a bad thing: “they that deny a
                     God destroy man’s nobility...if he be not kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble
                     creature”(Bacon, of Atheism). This passage is arguing that having certainty in God makes a man
                     noble and it can help humans in pursuing truth. People having faith in God believes in everything
                     God says or does. People believe that God can bring them truth, but it doesn’t prove that having
                     certainty will lead to truth. Desire certainty in knowledge means rejecting skepticism, but having
                     faith in God does not require people to reject any knowledge. Instead, it actually brings people
                     the courage and confidence to discover new things. God creates humans with the ability to learn and
                     to question as Bacon discussed in of atheism “when he resteth and assured himself upon divine
                     protection and favour, gathereth a force and faith, which human nature in itself could not
                     obtain”(Bacon, of atheism). God provides people the courage and confidence to be skeptical. Having
                     certainty in God does not make people desire certainty for knowledge, instead, they are encouraged
                     to doubt and question knowledge. Therefore desiring certainty in God doesn’t contradict the idea
                     that rejecting uncertainties leads to ignorance. Rather, it supports the idea that was brought up
                     by both Montaigne and Bacon that people should be skeptical. God gives humans the capacity to test
                     and reflect on knowledge, otherwise, they will be ignorant.



                  </p>

                  <p>
                     As Montaigne and Bacon both agree on, the greatest obstacle in humans’ search for knowledge is the
                     desire for certainty. Humans prefer conventions over innovation. They used to be satisfied with
                     what they know and reject uncertainties. Not being skeptical restricts people’s knowledge. The
                     desire for certainty can lead to a life with denial and ignorance, it lowers people’s awareness for
                     false knowledge and keeps them antiquated. People have a tendency to only listen to what they
                     believe in and reject any contrary ideas without any form of questioning, and it makes people
                     ignorant. People lack self-reflection and judge things based on their own knowledge. They don’t
                     question nor test their own information, which makes it possible for people to learn false
                     knowledge. Also, the desire for certainty means a lack of innovations. People who reject
                     uncertainties are likely to reject innovations which make their ideas antiquated since society is
                     always developing.
