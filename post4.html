                  <p>Secularization is an idea that arises in the Enlightenment that suggests to shift the focus from
                     God to the people. There is evidence in both Hume and Voltaire’s work that supports the idea of
                     Secularization. Hume and Voltaire are both critical of religion but in different approaches. They
                     both critique religion as a form of hypocrisy, but Hume mainly argues against the existence of
                     religion and its figure, as it violates the laws of nature; while Voltaire focuses more on
                     attacking religious institutions and people, who demonstrate corruption and immorality. By showing
                     the critics of religion, both authors demonstrate some evidence of why and how to achieve
                     secularization.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     From Hume and Voltaire’s perspective, religion is a form of hypocrisy. In other words, it creates
                     an appearance of virtue but fails to express and follow it. In Of Miracles, Hume discusses how
                     believing in miracles is not rational because there is not enough evidence proving its existence,
                     therefore, having faith in religion based on miracles is not rational either. He argues that “A
                     religionist may be an enthusiast and imagine he sees what has no reality. He may know his narrative
                     to be false and yet preserve in it with the best intentions in the world, for the sake of promoting
                     so holy a cause” (Hume, Of Miracles, pg.580). Here, Hume is saying that religionists may create a
                     false narrative or describe a wrong idea rather than telling the truth, in order to create a holy
                     image of a certain religion or to get support. Hume is an advocate of empiricism. He attacks the
                     idea that one should believe in God based on miracles because no empirical evidence is found to
                     support it. The action of religionists spreading false knowledge, for example, miracles, is not
                     sincere. One is not being devout to intentionally create a holy cause for people to believe in a
                     religion. Hume thinks that people are tempted to have a certain religion due to the false image
                     created by religionists. Therefore, he argues that religion is a form of hypocrisy. Voltaire, in
                     Candide, uses satire to argue against a certain religion. El Dorado is one of the countries that
                     Candide visited. It is a rich country and unknown by most of the world. When Candide asks about
                     their religion, he is surprised because they all have one religion and they don’t have priests.
                     Candide keeps asking“What, you don’t have monks who teach, who argue, who rule, who conspire, and
                     who burn people who don’t agree with them?” and the people in El Dorado answer: “Here we all agree
                     with each other, and we don’t understand what you’re trying to say with your talk about monks.
                     ”(Voltaire, Candide, pg.39) Candide describes the priest as someone who is cruel and has power. But
                     in El Dorado, people have the same religion. They won’t have conflicts therefore they don’t need
                     priests. Voltaire describes El Dorado as an example of a nearly perfect country. By contrasting the
                     religions in two different countries, Voltaire is suggesting that people in Candide’s country don’t
                     really have a religion, but blindly listen to and follow the rules set by the powerful people. They
                     are being forced to have certain beliefs rather than consenting to it by themselves like what El
                     Dorado people are doing. Religion in Candide’s country is a way for the sovereign to suppress
                     people. Voltaire argues that it’s hypocrisy instead of a religion where people should put faith in.
                     Hume and Voltaire both criticize religion as hypocrisy, and in their reasoning, they all imply the
                     idea of secularization where people should be the focus rather than God. Both authors think
                     religion should not be like rules that force people to do things, but beliefs that people all
                     consent to. People should be the ones who set the rules.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Upon the critics Hume and Voltaire give toward religion, it is clear that religion is a form of
                     hypocrisy. However, they explain their reasons through different approaches. Hume, being an
                     advocate for empiricism, thinks that in order to become a law of nature, one should have the best
                     evidence in its favor. By applying this idea, he argues that having beliefs in unjustifiable
                     religion is against the laws of nature. Hume makes a strong claim in Of Miracles to support his
                     idea: “We may establish it as a maxim that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a
                     miracle and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion”(Hume, pg.584) Hume believes
                     that no evidence can prove the existence of miracles, which means it can not be made as foundation
                     for any religion. People believe in miracles, therefore they have faith in God. When the miracles
                     can not be proved, the religion should not be trusted either, since God’s existence can not be
                     justified. Believing in either miracles or the existence of this religion is a violation of the
                     laws of nature because neither can be proved. At the end of Of Miracles, Hume concludes that
                     “Christina religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be
                     believed by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its
                     veracity”(Hume, pg.586) Here, Hume is saying believing in Christian religion on the basis of
                     miracles is not rational. By attacking the existence of miracles and the religion that has the
                     foundation on miracles, Hume criticizes religion as hypocrisy since it violates the laws of nature
                     and implies an idea that rather than having unjustified religious figures, humans should be the
                     focus instead.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                     While Hume criticizes religion by attacking the existence of certain religious figures, Voltaire
                     has a different approach where he mainly argues against the corrupt and immoral religious
                     institutions and people. Voltaire shows his attitudes towards religion by describing some religions
                     in Candide in satire. Candide encounters an old woman who was a princess but ended up in Morocco as
                     a slave. She tells Candide they are always fighting “My companions and fellow captives, those who
                     had captured them, soldiers, sailors, blacks, browns, whites, half-castes, and finally my captain
                     were all killed...while everyone continued faithfully to pray five times a day as required by
                     Mohammed”(Voltaire, pg.23) They are Muslims, who fight vicious war but still pray every day.
                     Voltaire criticizes religion as hypocrisy because people act against their religions sometimes. The
                     description of the war, in contrast to the description of their prayings, shows clearly how cruel
                     those people are. It creates an appearance that people are devout and they pray five times every
                     day, but when it comes to conflicts and wars, people are no longer following what they have faith
                     in. Religion should have more effects mentally other than teaching people the physical action of
                     praying. Later, Candide sails with Matin to Bordeaux. On the journey they see a Dutch ship being
                     sunk by French and Spanish ship, and the Dutch pirate is the person who robbed Candide. Candide is
                     happy to see him being punished, but Martin answers him: “but was it necessary that the passengers
                     who were on his should die as well? God may have punished this wretch, but it was the devil who
                     drowned the rest of them.”(Voltaire, pg.48) In other words, Matin thinks the Dutch pirate deserves
                     his death, but the rest of the people on the ship should not be treated the same way. Voltaire
                     implies that it is the people who are cruel and immoral, they are the “devil” that causes the death
                     of innocents. Some religions may ask people to pray for redemption when they make mistakes, but
                     it’s never a reason for them to be killed. Having someone killed as their redemption is not moral,
                     besides it may involve the lives of other innocent people. People sometimes use it as an excuse for
                     their cruel actions, like the one described above. Voltaire thinks that people have different
                     understandings of the beliefs in religion, they might interpret it in a wrong way that will
                     eventually lead to their immoral actions. And it then makes certain religion a form of hypocrisy.
                     He criticizes religion by attacking religious people and their immoral actions, which is quite
                     different from Hume’s approach.

                  <p>
                     While it appears that Hume attacks the existence of certain religions and views them as hypocrisy,
                     some may argue that instead of rejecting the existence of God, Hume is only attacking the existence
                     of miracles and promoting the idea to have faith in God. As Hume concludes that “Whoever is moved
                     by faith to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person which subverts all the
                     principles of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to
                     custom and experience.”(Hume, pg.586) Some might argue that Hume here is arguing that people should
                     have beliefs because of faith, rather than miracles. The only miracle that exists is the miracle of
                     one’s own mind to subvert all his or her experiences and principles and to have faith and consent
                     to it. It suggests that Hume is actually arguing for a faith-based belief in the existence of God.
                     However, this interpretation is not consistent with the ideas of Hume as an empiricist. It
                     contrarians to the view that all ideas should be based on empirical evidence. So the above quote
                     should be interpreted differently. Instead, Hume is saying people who believe in the existence of
                     miracles or God are doing what is contrary to society’s customs and principles. In other words,
                     against the laws of nature. When people subvert his or her own experiences and understandings to
                     believe in a religion, he/she is actually performing a miracle to him or herself which is
                     irrational. It is clear that Hume is against the existence of miracles, and instead of advocating
                     for faith-based belief, he believes that believing in a religion is not rational since it’s not
                     justified.

                  <p>
                     Hume and Voltaire are both critical of religion due to its hypocrisy, but they stake quite
                     different approaches in their explanations. Hume argues that since there is no empirical evidence
                     supporting the existence of the basis of religion, the existence of religion is against the laws of
                     nature. And since it is irrational to believe in a religion, its beliefs and contents can be
                     misleading and cause it to become a form of hypocrisy. Voltaire criticizes it through a different
                     approach. By providing evidence of certain cruel and immoral actions done by the religious people
                     and institutions in Candide, Voltaire argues against the religious people who make religion
                     hypocrisy. Through their criticism of the religion, both authors bring up the idea of
                     secularization, and suggest that all ideas should focus more on people rather than God.
