					<!-- overview -->
					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<p>In this project, we designed a website for a La Jolla local cheese shop - Smallgoods. We were
						able to design
						both the desktop and mobile version of the website through a series of research, testing,
						analysis and prototyping.
						We started with a initial client survey and user testing to learn about the needs from our
						clients and users.
						The final designs were then completed through a series of sketches, wireframes, prototypes and
						testings.
					</p>

					<!-- Introduction -->
					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						Smallgoods is a La Jolla, CA Cheese shop & Deli & Cafe that focused on American-made products.
						Smallgoods specializes exclusively in American farmstead cheeses, cured meats, sliced deli meats
						and gourmet.
						The Owner of Smallgoods - Jenny & Mike, started their business in South California in the Fall
						of 2015.
						They started in the Farmer's market as a pilot study, and later in Febreary of 2020, they opened
						the cheese shop&cafe in
						La Jolla, California. They opened their shop just 4 weeks before COVID and stay-home order
						happened, they put in a lot effort to
						stay open during the pandemic and we were hoping to help them by designing a website that is
						tailored to their shop.
					</p>

					<!-- Client survey -->
					<h1>Client Survey</h1>
					<p>
						We started by conducting a client survey, asking Jenny and Mike questions about the Smallgoods’
						business structure, users and their evaluation on their current website and expectation on the
						new website. After the interview with Jenny and Mike, we were able to determine the basic
						business model of the startup.The following client survey analysis highlights what Mike and
						Jenny expect Smallgoods’ website to perform for them as well as their ideal marketing portfolio.
					</p>

					<p>In the survey, we divided our questions into three catrgories: Business structure, Users and
						Website analysis. Here is a summary and analysis of the client survey </p>
					<a target="_blank" href="files/smallgoods/ClientSurvey.pdf"><p class="task" style="text-decoration: underline;"> A full list of client survey questions & analysis can be viewed here</p>
						</a>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<!-- <h3>Business structures</h3>
							<h5 style="font-size: large;">Survey Questions</h5>
							<p class="task">- How would you describe Smallgoods? What are your overall business goals?
								What have you done or changed during this pandemic? Why? </p>
							<p class="task">- How would you describe your brand in three words? </p>
							<p class="task">- What types of goods/services are available? Are there special offers for
								clients?</p>
							<p class="task">- Who are your competitors? What are the points of differentiation that are
								pulling customers to choose your store?</p> -->

							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Summary</h5>
							<p>Smallgoods is a boutique cafe with a strong emphasis on American-made cheese. They also
								sell sandwiches and other quick-lunch meals. </p>
							<p>While there are many cheese shops in San Diego, Smallgoods is unique and different in the
								way that they only sell American made products. When they were in NYC, they got to see
								many products from different countries and as they are now in San Diego, they wanted
								people to like American products and form attachments with products from their home
								country. </p> -->
							<!-- <p>Smallgoods sells varieties of products while their emphasis is on cheese. Besides cheese
								and cheese platters, they also have cured meat, sandwiches, salads, etc. Some of the
								cheese they sell is only available for a certain time and they change frequently. It
								also serves a way to keep customers coming back and find out about their new products.
								Smallgoods have different products when it comes to holidays and it keeps the experience
								new for customers.</p> -->
							<p>There are three major competitors Smallgoods has in general. The first one is the grocery
								store. Mike and Jenny mentioned that when they used to live in NYC, there are many small
								shops and boutiques and people go to specific shops for specific products. After they
								moved to San Diego, they found that people basically buy everything from grocery stores.
								And people tend to buy cheese in grocery stores rather than cheese shops. The second
								competitor is other cheese shops, and they mentioned there is a famous cheese shop
								called Venissimo. The third one is other cafes or sandwich shops. Smallgoods also sells
								sandwiches and other food for a quick lunch. They mentioned that fast food shops, and
								other sandwich shops can also be their potential competitors.</p>

							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Analysis</h5>
							<p>The selling point of Smallgoods’ products is they are all American-made. Mike and Jenny
								didn’t open Smallgoods for any big business goals, but more for personal interests
								because they felt obligated to detach the common negative connotations of American-made
								produce. We will put “American Artisanal products” as one of the emphasis while
								designing the website. To an extent, it will be plausible to brand Smallgoods as an
								American patriotic company that aims to highlight the key features of what makes
								American produce remarkable.
							</p> -->
							<!-- <p>It would be necessary to include the different varieties of products on the website, but
								as there are a number of them, we will have to further discuss how to prioritize them.
								As mentioned by Mike and Jenny, there were not many special offers, but they do have
								special products during the holidays. we could have a page that introduces the event and
								products when a particular holiday is coming. Another thing to take into consideration
								is the constant change of menu as Jenny and Mike want to keep a relatively new
								experience to every customer that convinces them to discover more for both returners and
								newcomers. This is an essential characteristic that should be highlighted in the website
								that the experience with Smallgoods is far beyond guaranteed delicious products and more
								of the exploratory experience.
							</p> -->
							<!-- <p>Knowing the competitors, the next step will be doing competitive analysis and
								interviewing the users to see what they liked about smallgoods. By conducting a
								competitive analysis of other cheese shops, we could draw inspiration from them and use
								them for the design of our website. By interviewing the users, we could know what are
								some things that customers liked or some distinct things about Smallgoods cheese and we
								can highlight them on the website to attract more customers.
							</p> -->

						</li>

							<!-- <h3>Users</h3>
							<h5 style="font-size: large;">Survey Questions</h5>
							<p class="task">- Who are your ideal primary customers? What groups of customers purchase
								your products? </p>
							<p class="task">- How do you think the customers mostly find the store? </p>
							<p class="task">- How have your customers changed over time? Do you have more loyal
								customers or newcomers?</p>
							<p class="task">- What type of customers are you hoping to target the most through the
								website?</p> -->

							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Summary</h5> -->
							<p>Most of the current customers live in surrounding communities and are 50-60-year-old
								semi-retired and retired people. Besides, most of the customers are returning customers
								either from the farmer’s market or their store. In the store, the returning customers
								take up 50%-60% of the total amount, which is a pretty high percentage showing that the
								current customers are extremely loyal. Compared with the older generation customers that
								they have, Smallgoods wants more younger generations to engage in their business. Their
								ideal primary customers are young people who are willing to spend small amounts of money
								on their product and enjoy the experience. They want to advertise their product online
								to attract younger customers since younger generations are more familiar with digital
								devices. </p>


							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Analysis</h5>
							<p>Smallgoods will be a good place for educating kids with good and fresh products on diet.
								This could provide a special experience for families. We can make an activity page for
								attracting families that want similar experiences. Also, since the current customers are
								pretty loyal, the website will be targeting new younger customers. The design should
								match the young generation’s taste.
							</p> -->

							<!-- <h3>Website Analysis</h3>
							<h5 style="font-size: large;">Survey Questions</h5>
							<p class="task">- What are the top 3 ideal themes are you looking for for your website?</p>
							<p class="task">- What content do you want to include on your website? Any specific features
								you would like included such as a special offers menu, blog, subscription services, or
								newsletters? </p>
							<p class="task">- What are some things that you want to keep or remove from your current
								website? Why?</p> -->

							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Summary</h5> -->
							<p>The three main themes that Mike and Jenny are looking for in their website are:
								Informative, easy to use, and engaging. One thing Mike emphasized is that he wanted the
								users of their website to know that they need to come to the store to get the product
								and online orders are not supported at this point. They wanted the website to be
								informative so that customers can know when, what, and how to reach them. The second
								theme is easy to use. They hope the customers can navigate and find the information they
								need quickly without having to wonder where to go. The functions on the website should
								be efficient. The third one is engaging, Mike and Jenny want their website to be
								interesting and contain information not only about products and services, but also
								include information and stories about the shop. </p>
							<!-- <p>
								One of the most important things that they would like to include in the website is the
								basic information about the shop and how customers can reach them. As Mike and Jenny
								mentioned, the website is not set up for online orders, they want the customers to know
								and provide information for customers to reach them such as locations, hours of
								operation, emails, phone numbers. While it does not support online orders, they still
								want to include their products especially cheese platter on the website, along with the
								descriptions. They also mentioned that they have an Instagram account and their current
								website has the live instagram feed and they would like to keep that as well.
							</p> -->
							<!-- <p>
								Smallgoods wants to keep the website simple and remove unnecessary information such as
								history. The redesign should be based on the current website and have a space for
								displaying Instagram feeds. Mike and Jenny mentioned that the history part of the
								current website can be removed. And generally, they wanted an overall revamp of their
								current website.
							</p> -->


							<!-- <h5 style="font-size: large;">Analysis</h5>
							<p>When designing, we will keep the logo, and the section of live Instagram feed, but maybe
								we will change the overall layout and put the section of Instagram feed to a different
								location. The website will look simple and we will remove anything that is not necessary
								and add new contents mentioned. We will make the basic information of the store easy to
								see so that customers can
								immediately know what they can and can not do from the website and if they do want to
								buy the products, how to reach them. We will also have information about the products
								and visual images. To make it engaging, interesting in some way that attracts the users
								to further explore. We will use visual images and maybe include some interactive
								features to make the website more engaging. We will also need a balance engaging and
								informative at the same time.
							</p> -->
						</li>

					</ul>
					<p>
						After analyzing the client survey, we made a priority list of what should be our top focuses.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p class="task">Emphasis on American made products</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="task">Keep the original website logo with its color scheme and similar typography
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="task">The website should be informative, easy to use, and engaging</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="task">Include clear and noticeable general information(Location, Hours, Contacts)
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="task">Product first along with high-quality pictures, condensed in text.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="task">Include product page, and live Instagram feed.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- user interviews -->
					<img src="images/smallgoods/user.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
					<h1>User Interviews</h1>
					<p>
						From the client interview, the stakeholders had given us a starting point regarding their loyal
						customers are mostly at retirement age in the store’s neighborhood and those who had purchased
						products from their farmer market’s pilot experiment. These loyal customers are less likely to
						be visiting Smallgoods website because they had already established a relationship with
						Smallgoods. Based on the answers of the 9 users we interviewed, we came up with three personae
						groups are who either love cheese, willfulness to spend money, or seek cafe experience.

					<!-- competitive analysis -->
					<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
					<p>
						As a cheese cafe place, few features must be present in Smallgoods’ website. We choose 5
						competitors of Smallgoods: Cheese Shop La Jolla Shores, Fish Shop, Grater Grilled Cheese, The
						Cheese Shop Inc., and iGourmet. These competitors shared many similarities and there are also
						unique functions presented in each.

					<p>
						From the competitive analysis, we were able to generate some ideas for designing webiste for
						Smallgoods
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Gallery includes pictures of both the food and the environment of the shop
								Pictures are consistent with the brand of the shop
								Let users know what the shop look like and what they can order
								Allow a good initial impression of the shop
								Given users an idea of what the experience will be like
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Providing social media links and showing pictures from the platform is a good way to
								connect
								with users
								Easier for users to see, rather than having the icons in the corner of the page.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Show signature products on the homepage. It would be helpful for the first-time users.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								High-quality poster can be a really good way of promoting. Users can get stronger visual
								perception from
								both text and image.</p>

					<h1>Moodboard</h1>
					<img src="images/smallgoods/moodboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">


					<h1>Wireframes</h1>
					<p>
						Wireframes can be really helpful in laying out the functionalities and contents needed on the
						site. Before prototyping,
						we first created a site map, organzing the navigation and contents of the site, then
						we designed the wireframes to have an idea of what the site navigation should look like.
					</p>
					<h3>Site map</h3>

					<h1>Testing</h1>
					<p>
						After wireframes, we started a series of iterative prototypes where we conducted user testings
						after each prototype
						and solve the problems identified from the testings, repeatedly.
					</p>

				

					<h3>Testings</h3>
					<p>
						From this round of user testing, the problems found are mostly about the accessibility of
						information. We tested the final prototype with 3 users and a problem that was brought up by two
						users was that they didn’t know how to order cheese using the website. They were expecting an
						online order service from the website, but did not find one. Smallgoods does not have an online
						ordering service and from the testing, we realized that we did not make this clear on the
						website. To improve on this, we made changes to the homepage by adding a phrase that tells users
						to “call ahead to make orders” in the menu section. The goal is that users will know the website
