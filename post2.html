                  <p>Armitage and Eliot, in their poems, are trying to demonstrate the deviation of modern practices
                     from the tradition by drawing connections between past and present events, but their approaches and
                     interpretations are different. To show how tradition practices are being constrained in modern
                     life, Armitage and Eliot connects the past and present in different ways: Armitage reframes the
                     modern issue of refugees in a way that fits in the past journey of Aeneas, while Eliot
                     recontextualizes several fragmented past events as part of modern life. Through the difference they
                     presented between the past and present, Armitage and Eliot both indicate a problem of the loss of
                     compatible interaction between individuals and the world. However, they provide quite contrasting
                     interpretations on how this problem leads to the deviation from traditions: Armitage argues that
                     the loss of traditional practices is due to self-deprivation of individuals, whereas Eliot tries to
                     say that the disruption of tradition is due to people prioritizing individualism. This indicates
                     that tradition operates on the basis of active harmony between oneself and the community.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Both On the Existing State of Things and the Waste Land draw connections between the past and
                     present, and by doing so, two poets agree on the idea that reality of modern life poses challenges
                     that lead to its deviation from the traditions. However, the way they connect the two are
                     different. In On the Existing State of Things, Armitage uses Aeneas’ journey as a background and
                     reframes the issue of modern refugees to fit in the background story. He chooses the part where
                     Aeneas travelled to the underworld and he writes “With a scraggly grey beard under his bloodshot
                     eyes/ and a money bag slung from his bony shoulder/ he tacks and jibes, tunes the outboard
                     motor...”(Armitage, On the Existing State of Things, 84) Here, Armitage describes Charon who is the
                     ferryman in the underworld, as someone who lived in modern times that has a money bag and motor
                     boat. Armitage adds these details to suggest that the poem is talking about a modern issue, even
                     though it is describing a past character. While Armitage uses the past as a background, Eliot
                     focuses more on modern life and adds in fragmented past events. He captures a conversation between
                     two men “ ‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!/ That corpse you planted last year in your
                     garden,/ Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?”(Eliot, the Waste Land, I.70-72) This is
                     a conversation about World War 1, but he uses words like “corpse”, “sprout” “bloom” to make it
                     sound like a modern day conversation about gardening. Armitage and Eliot, through different
                     approaches, connect the past and present, aiming at showing the deviation of modern practices from
                     traditions.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Although the approaches of how Armitage and Eliot link the past and present are different, the loss
                     of active interactions between individuals and the world in modern life is a shared problem that
                     has been identified by both poets in both poems through their comparison between the past and
                     present. In On the Existing State of Things, Armitage describes the refugees as “so many souls,
                     countless as dry leaves/ loosen by frost, spinning through autumn woods”(Armitage, 84)Here,
                     refugees are being described as loosen leaves. “Spinning through autumn woods” is saying that
                     although the leaves may still be in the woods, they are no longer connected to the trees. Using the
                     simile of loose leaves, Armitage is trying to imply that although the refugees may still be living
                     with their families or friends, they are not connected to their community any more. They are no
                     longer part of their traditional community they came from. The interaction between oneself and the
                     world is missing because of both their physical and spiritual detachment from the community, and
                     fleeing from their home country makes them more distant from their traditions. Similarly, Eliot
                     identifies the problem of the loss of harmony between individuals and the world in his poem, the
                     Waste Land. He described a scene in London “A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many/ I had not
                     thought death had undone so many/ Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled/ And each man fixed his
                     eyes before his feet” (Eliot, I.62-65) People in modern London are like those described by Dante
                     who lived their lives without praise or blame, they are living a life without faiths and beliefs.
                     “Crow flowed” shows a large number of people, and “fixed his eyes before his feet” shows how
                     isolated they are. The two phrases created a contrast that shows what it looks like when such a
                     large number of people in a society are isolated and detached from their community. A reason for
                     that could be what Dante suggested: people have no beliefs. Without common beliefs, people are
                     actually living in an empty space with no interaction with others. It leads to the loss of
                     connection between individuals and the world. Both Armitage and Eliot agree that there is a
                     difference between the traditions and modern practices, and it is due to the loss of interaction
                     between individuals and the world.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     While both Armitage and Eliot argue that the interaction between individuals and the world, which
                     is an important component of tradition, is lost in modern life, they provide different
                     interpretations on how this problem affects the modern practices and leads to the loss of
                     tradition. Armitage argues that self-deprivation is the reason for individuals' detachment from the
                     community, and causes the loss of tradition. A character Armitage mentions in his poem is
                     Palinurus. Palinurus, In the Aeneid, is a helmsman of Aeneas’s fleet. He fell off the boat on their
                     way to Italy and died. Armitage mentions a conversation between his ghost and the Aeneas, “Aeneas
                     called out, ‘Palinurus, answer me; which God tipped the Mediterranean into your lungs?’/ And the
                     dead sailor replied, ‘No God, captain./ It was my one job to chart a course by the
                     stars’’(Armitage, 85) In the Aeneid, Palinrus’s journey to Italy with Aeneas and his death are all
                     determined by God. Here, he is saying that no God forces him to do it. Armitage is actually
                     referring to the refugees who, unlike Palinurus, are not given a predetermined destination. It’s
                     Palinurus’s job to sail for Italy, but the refugees are not being forced to go. Given the refugees
                     live in a modern society, they have the option to gather their community and fight back.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     However, they choose to flee rather than defending themselves. Aeneas built Rome after fleeing from
                     Troy, but modern refugees lack the ability to see their own values and power. Instead, they
                     deprioritize their own lives and let others decide what is good for them. Their self-deprivation
                     makes them detached from the community. Losing the connection with one’s community also means the
                     loss of cultural traditions. Armitage argues that the traditional practices are disrupted because
                     individuals lack self-valuation. However, Eliot has a different argument and suggests that it is
                     due to people prioritizing individualism. In the Waste Land, Eliot depicts many scenes about the
                     relationship between male and female, “He wept. He promised ‘a new start’/ I made no comment. What
                     should I resent”(Eliot, III.298-299) When the man promises his lover a new start, the woman “made
                     no comment”. She doesn’t care what the man wants to do. Rather than playing a traditional role of
                     women, the woman here sees herself as an individual that doesn’t need help from men. The
                     traditional connection between male and females is broken in modern society. By showing the broken
                     relationship between men and women, Eliot is implying that the connections between individuals in
                     general are broken. People in modern life tend to think as individuals rather than as members of
                     the community. Also, he writes toward the end of the poem “DA/ Datta: what have we given?/...DA/
                     Dayadhvam: I have heard the key/...DA/ Damyata: the boat responded”(Eliot, V.400-418)Here, Eliot is
                     using words from Hindu Upanishad to tell people to be generous and have sympathy, which implies
                     that people in modern society are indifferent to others and prioritizing individualism. By giving
                     suggestions to how one should treat others in a community, Eliot is implying the loss of
                     interactions within individuals and between individuals and the community. Without mutual
                     interaction between individuals and the world, traditional practices will disappear. Between
                     Armitage and Eliot, the arguments on how the loss of active harmony between individuals and the
                     community lead to the deviation from tradition hold differ; Armitage argues that the problem is due
                     to self-deprivation while Eliot believes that the deviation from tradition is caused by
                     individualism.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     While it appears that Armitage identifies self-deprivation as a problem that causes the loss of
                     tradition, some might argue that Armitage is putting the blame on the society and reality of modern
                     life rather than people. In the poem, Armitage describes a scene of the refugees suffering from the
                     journey “But sheer cliffs and savage rocks defeated me;/ in heavy waterlogged clothes I hung on by
                     my nails/ till cold and weakness prised my fingers from the stone”(Armitage, 85) Someone might
                     argue that this scene is not only describing their sufferings in natural environment, but their
                     suffer in the society of modern life. Unlike Aeneas, refugees in modern life have to consider more
                     factors. It is impossible for them to be like Aeneas who built a new city after fleeing from Troy.
                     They seem to suggest that the reality should be the one to be blamed. It is evident from the poem
                     that Armitage suggests modern society deviates from the past, however, there is also evidence
                     showing the problem of self-deprivation of individuals. Armitage describes the refugees as those
                     who are waiting to be crossed by Charon in the underworld: “husbands and wives, the drained
                     dishevelled forms/of the once-proud, bewildered children,/pale daughters and sons pulled from
                     rubble and ash”(Armitage,84) By using the word “once-proud”, Armitage is contrasting between how
                     proud people used to be and how frail and timid they are now. They were once proud, but now just
                     like others in the underworld. In the underworld, “Charon trafficked as he pleased''(Armitage, 84).
                     The refugees are treated like cargo. The loss of agency is due to their self-deprivation. They give
                     up on themselves and let “Charon” take control. One difference between the refugees and Aeneas is
                     that the Underworld is somewhere the Aeneas chooses to go to, but the refugees are forced to go
                     there. Rather than blaming the society, Armitage is suggesting that self-deprivation of people in
                     the modern society is the problem that leads to its deviation from traditions. Instead of putting
                     the blame on modern reality, self-deprivation is what makes modern refugees different from Aeneas,
                     and eventually leads to loss of traditional practices in modern life.
