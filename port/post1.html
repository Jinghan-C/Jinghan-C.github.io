                  <p>Camus proposes an idea that “the long fight for justice exhausts the love that nevertheless gave
                     birth to it”. Meanwhile, Camus and Heaney argue that, given the absurdity of the world, one can
                     only persevere without surrendering either love or justice by using imagination. Imagination is
                     where people can return to the sources and re-evaluate the meaning of love and justice. This idea
                     can be evident in Camus’ description of the transcendent moment in Return to Tipasa, Dr. Rieux’s
                     imaginative escape from reality in the Plague and Heaney’s imaginative memory in his poem
                     Clearances. By providing this potential solution, both Camus and Heaney are implying the absurdity
                     of the real world, as justice and love are always conflicting; and suggest that using imagination
                     to revitalize love is actually one’s realization of the absurdity. </p>

                  <p>
                     Camus argues that persevering without surrendering either love or justice can only be done through
                     imagination. This idea is evident in Camus’ pictures of the transcendent moment in his essay Return
                     to Tipasa. Tipasa is an old Roman city now in ruins. Camus spent quite a lot of time in Tipasa when
                     he was young, and this essay is mainly about his second visit to Tipasa after World War II. In
                     Tipasa, Camus returns to nature and sees the sea first “rose slowly in the ill-defined bay, but the
                     surface of the water seemed almost motionless under the steady rain”(Return to Tipasa, pg195) Here,
                     Camus imagines himself being the sea. Like the sea which is “motionless”, Camus stopped feeling. He
                     came back to Tipasa to reconnect with the world as it is a place with his happy memories. After the
                     transcendent experience, he now “listened to the happy torrents rising within me”(Return to Tipasa,
                     pg 201) Being the sea, which has “happy torrents”, Camus now has revitalized his feelings. In this
                     imagination, he experiences a transcendent moment. He “listened to an almost forgotten sound within
                     myself as if my heart, long stopped, were calmly beginning to beat again. And awake now, I
                     recognized one by one the imperceptible sounds of which the silence was made up.” (Return to
                     Tipasa, pg.201) During this second visit, Camus describes this transcendent moment where his
                     stopped heart beats again and he hears the sound of silence. This transcendental experience is in
                     his imagination, his heart did not stop, nor can he hear the silent sound. These are referring to
                     the source of his feelings and emotions as he has lost them while fighting for justice. Here, by
                     saying his heart “beat again”, Camus is saying that love is reanimated within him and he can
                     finally perceive and have feelings for himself and the world. In this transcendent moment, he
                     regains what he should have and becomes more the person he should be. By returning to Tipase and
                     imagining himself being a sea in Tipasa, Camus is going back to the source of love both physically
                     and mentally. After experiencing the war and French Resistance, Camus’ feelings are exhausted.
                     Through the imagination of being a sea, he regenerates love. During the mental fight for justice,
                     Camus realizes the absurdity of the world as he could not retain the love and other feelings while
                     still obtaining justice. Given the conflict position between love and justice, He reanimates love
                     through the transcendent moment in his imagination.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The idea of using imagination to reanimate love while still maintaining justice is also evident in
                     Camus’ The Plague, specifically in the description of Rieux’s imaginative escape from the disease.
                     Rieux and Tarrou meet up one day to visit a patient and end up having a talk at the terrace of a
                     patient's house. Being a doctor, Rieux’s feelings are exhausted by the plague: “No resource was
                     left him but to tighten the stranglehold on his feelings and harden his heart protectively. For he
                     knew this was the only way of carrying on” (Camus, The Plague, chapter19) Aftering seeing so many
                     people die, the only way for Rieux to continue his work is to hide his feelings. “Tighten his
                     feelings” is the only way to protect himself and to better help others. Realizing that he could not
                     continue without surrendering either justice or love, Rieux knows he has to choose only one of them
                     and he chooses justice. He chooses to continue to help people because it is his job and it is the
                     right thing to do. Luckily, he reanimates love through imagination. While they are swimming after
                     the friendship talk, Rieux imagines them being “isolated from the world, at last free of the town
                     and of the plague”(The Plague, chapter24). The imagination brings Rieux back to the time before the
                     plague where he still has passion and hope for life. The imaginative escape from the plague brings
                     him to the source of love. He finally gets a chance to take a break in this fight and think for
                     himself. In the imagination, without the exhausting fight with the plague, “Rieux could feel under
                     his hand the gnarled, weather-worn visage of the rocks, and a strange happiness possessed him...a
                     happiness that forgot nothing, not even murder”(The Plague, chapter24) Here, “strange” shows that
                     Rieux has lost happiness for so long that he is unfamiliar with it now. “A happiness that forgot
                     nothing” shows one can maintain love without giving up justice. In the imaginative escape from
                     reality, Rieux discovers a way to obtain both love and justice. Rieux chooses to be a doctor
                     because he has love and he wants to save people. But during the fight with the plague, he becomes
                     indifferent and loses the love for not only the people, but also the world. The plague makes him
                     realize the absurdity of the world. Realizing that the absurd reality prevents people from
                     obtaining both love and justice, Rieux regains love through imaginative escape from the plague.

                     Seamus Heaney also argues the same idea in his poem Clearances where through imagination, one can
                     persevere without surrendering either love or justice. Heaney writes the poem in memory of his
                     mother. The poem is structured chronologically and it starts describing when his mother is near
                     death to the mourning for her. Heaney first describes a scene when he and his mother are peeling
                     potatoes together, and “Little pleasant splashes / From each other’s work would bring us to our
                     senses”(Seamus Heaney, Clearances, 3.7-8) and when his mother dies, he says “The space we stood
                     around had been emptied/ Into us to keep, it penetrated/ Clearances that suddenly stood open/ High
                     cries were felled and a pure change happened”(Clearances, 7.11-14) The time with his mother is
                     filled with happiness, and when she dies, everything changes. All he experiences is the clearances.
                     He lost his passion and hope for life. Then Heaney imagines himself going back to childhood and
                     depicts a scene in his memory. “I thought of walking round and round a space / .../ Where the
                     decked chestnut tree had lost its place” (Clearances, 8.1-3) Instead of talking about his mother,
                     Heaney uses analogy and focuses on the chestnut tree. The chestnut tree is no longer there, like
                     his mother who is no longer with him. Through his imaginative memory, he finds something new. He
                     learns to listen to silence “A soul ramifying and forever / Silent, beyond silence listened
                     for”(Clearances, 8) Here, Heaney describes the tree as a “ramifying soul” and he learns that even
                     though the tree doesn’t speak, it still has a soul. It makes him realize that silence is not really
                     silent. Having lost his mother, the world of Heaney is becoming silent. However, through the
                     imagination, he realizes that there is something in the silence he can look for. Although the space
                     is no longer filled with his mother’s voice, he can still listen to it and create new meanings of
                     life. While Heaney holds on to the love for his mother, he loses the meaning of life and he doesn’t
                     know what is the right thing to do. However, in the imaginative memory, he returns to the source
                     and finds meaning in it. He finds a way to keep the love for his mother while still loving the
                     world he himself lives in.

                     While it appears that imagination can help one persevere without surrendering either love or
                     justice, one would argue that there is not a real conflict between justice and love in Seamus
                     Heaney’s Clearance. Heaney describes “it penetrated clearances that suddenly stood open / High
                     cries were felled and a pure change happened” (Clearances, 7.12-13) Some may argue that the sudden
                     change that Heaney feels is the loss of the closeness between him and his mother rather than the
                     loss for passion and love for his own life. However, in the beginning, the poem starts with “Teach
                     me now to listen, / To strike it rich behind the linear back.”(Clearances,8-9) and it ends with
                     “Silent, beyond silence listened for”(Clearances, 8.14) Here, the poem mentions “listen” both in
                     the beginning and the end, which shows that what Heaney loses is not only the closeness with his
                     mother, but the ability to listen. When Heaney is in grief with the loss of his mother, he is
                     really in the fight for justice, and he doesn't really have control over whether he wants to join
                     the “fight”. He is doing the morally right thing by mourning for his mother, and sorrow is the
                     right emotion one should feel with the loss of a family member. In his fight for justice, Heaney
                     loses hope and passion, which is the ability to listen. The love for his own life is exhausted by
                     his just actions and emotions of mourning for his mother. He realizes this conflict between his
                     just actions and love for the world. To animate his love, he learns to listen to silence through
                     his imaginative memory.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Realizing the uncertainty and absurdity of the world, Camus and Heaney argue that the only way for
                     one to preserve both love and justice is through imagination, in which one can return to the
                     sources and reevaluate its meaning. In Return to Tipasa, Camus reanimates his love, which he lost
                     after the experiencing wars, through the imaginative transcendent moments in Tipasa. In The Plague,
                     Rieux is able to maintain both love and justice after the imaginative escape from reality. In his
                     poem Clearances, Heaney uses imaginative memory and re-learn the meaning of life, which brought him
                     back the love for the world. Both Camus and Heaney, by suggesting the use of imagination, are
                     implying the absurdity of the world.
