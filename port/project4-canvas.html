					<!-- overview -->
					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<p>This project focuses on evaluating and redesigning the app - Canvas Student.
						By conducting user research and competitive analysis, we identified some usability problems,
						and decided to redesign the inbox page. Through a series of sketching, prototyping, and user
						testing,
						we redesigned the inbox page of Canvas Student that effectively increases the efficiency and
						flexibility of use. </p>

					<img src="images/canvas/overview.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">


					<!-- Introduction -->
					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>
						Canvas student app is one of the most popular learning management systems and we use it almost
						every day to access course materials,
						check announcements, check grades and so on. We are interested in this app because during the
						current pandemic,
						the usage of online learning platforms has increased and using Canvas app (and other similar
						platforms) becomes an important part of our lives.
						By doing user testing and redesigning the Canvas Student app, hopefully we can make it more
						effective in facilitating remote learning. </p>



					<!-- user testing plan -->
					<h1>User Testing</h1>
					<ul id="canvas-task">
						<li>
							<h3>User Selection and limitations</h3>
							<p>For this project, we performed user testing with four users, who are all university
								students.
								We consider them to be valid users because most university students are required to use
								these online platforms such as Canvas,
								and especially during the pandemic, university students use it very frequently. However
								with selecting university students,
								there can be an inherent bias. For example, if one is still used to the previous
								platform (Blackboard),
								they may not be all that familiar with Canvas and may be limited in their knowledge of
								the platform.
								Also, users may be extremely comfortable with the platform, so there is a chance that we
								will have extreme outliers in our data.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Interviews and Tasks</h3>
							<p> Before asking users to perform tasks, we did a short interview with each user, asking
								questions about their age, school, majors,
								and their previous experience using Canvas or other online learning platforms. </p>
							<p class="task"> A full list of interview questions can be viewed here</p>
							<p> In the testing section, we prepared 6 tasks for user to do.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p class="task">A: Have you received any feedback from TA or instructor in this
										quarter? If so,
										fins the feedback from your instructor/TA for your most recently graded
										assignment. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">B: Have you ever had group assignments?
										Please explain and show how your group submits them. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">C: If you get a notification that you just received a message from
										your TA,
										find that message</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">D:Find a message sent last week from one of your TAs regarding an
										assignment due this week.</p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p class="task">E: How to send a message to your classmate/group member. </p>
								</li>

								<li>
									<p class="task">F: Find what you need to do on/before Dec. 11th. </p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Due to the current pandemic, we were only able to do zoom meetings with the users,
								with one member leading the section while others observe and take notes. After receiving
								consent,
								we asked the user to share the screen with us using her/his phone and open Canvas on
								his/her phone.
								The meetings were recorded and reviewed after the testing session.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Analysis of testings</h3>
							<p>Among the four users, only one user had problems with finding the feedback of an
								assignment.
								For the other three users, it is pretty easy for them to view feedback,
								mainly because they have been using the Canvas Student app for a while.
								In fact, the feedback is located under the “submission & rubric”, which can certainly
								confuse the users,
								causing them to ignore the tab and then cannot find any feedback through the mobile app.
							</p>
							<p>
								When performing the task of submitting group assignments,
								no users had problems doing it but all of them did it the same way as submitting
								individual assignments.
								The “group” section on the homepage did not provide ways to submit group assignments.
								Also, there are problems if they are not the ones to submit assignments,
								as it shows the assignment is missing on their ends even though the other members have
								already submitted it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Three of the four users encountered problems when performing the task involved using
								“inbox”.
								The “filter” in the “inbox” only provides filtering based on courses and is not clearly
								organized or displayed.
								Users also had problems looking for a particular message as they can’t recognize the
								TA’s name and the overview of a message sometimes doesn't show what course it is from.
								Also, since there are many messages about updates of zoom meetings, and there are no
								mass select functions.
								Since students are receiving Canvas messages via Gmail simultaneously,
								three of the users would prefer to check their email instead of Canvas,
								thus it often leaves users with many unread messages in Canvas.

					<!-- redeisgning component -->
					<h1>Redesigning component</h1>
					<p>After the tests and the analysis of the data that those tests produced,
						the one componet we would be redesigning is the organization of the inbox page. </p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Problem1</h3>
							<p>Users can only sort by courses and that having one restriction when
								it comes to sorting is not specific enough for the function to be genuinely effective.
							</p>

							<img src="images/canvas/problem1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>This violates the heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design. The different font sizes
								have no aesthetics and make users hard to read.
								Besides, it violates the heuristic of flexibility and efficiency of use because users
								have to pick their current enrolling courses among all courses that they have already
								taken,
								and it slows down the users instead of an accelerator.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Problem2</h3>
							<p>In the inbox, it lacks simple visual cues to help users instantly categorize messages in
								their head.
								Users had a hard time identifying the TA and didn’t know what course the message was
								sent from.
								For examples, simple visual cue such as tags for meetings, tags for sender (TA,
								Professor, or Other Students),
								color code for different classes would help student tremendously in figuring if the
								message belong to the dozens of spams zoom meeting
								that they get everyday or if its an actually important announcement being made by the
								professor.
							</p>

							<img src="images/canvas/problem2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>This violates the heuristic of recognition rather than recall. Users have to recall their
								professors
								and TAs’ names while they are checking messages without any information related to the
								course.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Problem3</h3>
							<p>There is no search bar nor is there a way to mass select messages to sort them up.
								If you wanted to sort messages you would have to do so one by one. And when you do them
								one by one,
								you would have to click onto each individual one first then tap the 3 dots on top then
								select delete,
								a lengthy process especially if you have a lot of messages.
							</p>

							<img src="images/canvas/problem3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>This violates the heuristic of flexibility and efficiency of use.
								Because the process of making changes is too redundant,
								and users cannot adjust each message on the inbox homepage.
								They have to access the third-level page to adjust a single message.
							</p>
						</li>

					</ul>
					<!-- end of redesign components -->



					<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
					<h1>Competitive analysis</h1>
					<p>After the tests and the analysis of the data that those tests produced,
						the one componet we would be redesigning is the organization of the inbox page. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Piazza</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/compete1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>Piazza is an excellent example of messaging for school courses. On the homepage,
								it separates messages into courses with active and inactive dividers.
								It is a straightforward design for users to check on each course’s messages instead of
								constructing all messages in one inbox.
								Within each course, it provides dividers for each week. Although it violates the
								heuristic of recognition than recall,
								it is still a good way to organize all the messages with a timeframe.
								This provides an optional solution for the first problem we identified in Canvas Student
								app.
								The separation of courses in advance will give users helpful guidance on what they are
								looking for.
								Besides, the timeframe will provide users with organized messages in the inbox.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Blackboard</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/compete2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>Blackboard is an app functioning similarly to Canvas Student App.
								In the activity stream tab, which has a similar function to the inbox,
								each message is specified with the course information, including the course ID and the
								course’s name, and color-coded.
								The color coding and the specification of the course information could solve the second
								problem we identified in Canvas Student app.
								This will give the users a more precise guide for what they are looking for.
								Color coding matching with the course color will enhance the aesthetics and visual cues
								for the users.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>UC San Diego</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/compete3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>UC San Diego mobile app provides a clear organization of filtering what users want to see
								on the homepage.
								This filter gives users flexibility and control of selecting information as well as the
								visibility of system status.
								This organization of information could solve the first problem we identified in Canvas
								Student app.
								We can put for options in the filter besides the courses enhancing the flexibility and
								user control.
							</p>
						</li>

					</ul>



					<!-- Sketches -->
					<h1>Redesign Sketches</h1>
					<p>Before starting on the prototypes, we made four sketches that provides four different solutions
						solving the problem of Canvas inbox. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Sketch1</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/sketch1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>In the first one, we designed the inbox in a similar way as the dashboard, except that
								the groups sections are eliminated.
								The users could choose to view all the messages or view messages from a specific course.
								In “All messages”, the user is reminded of the course name. The user could also search
								through the inbox or filter messages.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Sketch2</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/sketch2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>In the second sketch, we color coded the courses and added time frames where users can
								choose to see messages from specific week.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Sketch3</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/sketch3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>In the third sketch, we added a menu bar on top of the inbox page.
								The menu bar contains a list of courses and users can choose to see messages from a
								particular course.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Sketch4</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/sketch4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>In the fourth sketch, we color coded the courses and added a filter section that allow
								users to sort and search messages
							</p>
						</li>

					</ul>


					<!-- Redesign Prototypes and rationale -->
					<h1>Design rationale and prototypes</h1>
					<p>From the user interview and testing, we learned that people use Canvas Student app mostly for
						checking information
						(announcement, messages, grades, etc.). We found that the interactivity and content on the inbox
						page is badly managed.
						The messages in the inbox are not organized nor categorized and users had problems finding
						target messages. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Prototype 1</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/prototype1.1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/canvas/prototype1.2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<p>We color coded the messages and added the course name on each one, giving them
								categorizes, because users sometimes have a hard time identifying the TA. With the
								course name, users won’t have to click in message details to see what course it is from.
							</p>
							<p>We changed the top navigation bar which previously supports viewing unread, starred, sent
								messages to one that allows users to switch between different classes and see only
								messages from one course. From the user testings, we found that users rarely use the
								function to view only unread, sent, starred messages, but rather will look for messages
								from a particular class. We changed this top bar so that users will have quicker access
								to a particular message.
							</p>
							<p>We redesigned the filter to support more sorting functions. As we changed the top
								navigation bar, we moved those functions into the filter tab and users can still view
								only sent, starred or unread messages. We also added a function that allows users to
								select time frames because it narrows down the number of messages and helps users save
								time finding target messages. We provided a way for users to hide messages on zoom
								updates. Most unread messages are those about updates of zoom meetings, and there were
								so many that they take up much space on the inbox page. In the filter, we added a
								function for users to view only messages and hide those about zoom meetings so that
								distractions are reduced and users can access target messages faster.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Prototype 2</h3>
							<img src="images/canvas/prototype2.1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/canvas/prototype2.2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

							<p>Instead of showing all messages instantly when the user clicks on inbox, we added a step
								for users to select the course first. We made this change because this way the messages
								are organized by courses and users can have faster access to messages from a specific
								course.
							</p>
							<p>We added a timeline on top that allows users to view messages from a certain week only as
								the quarter is usually divided into weeks, we thought it would be helpful to show what
								week it is, and categorize the messages by the week it is from.
							</p>
							<p>Similar to the first prototype, we moved the unread, starred and sent tabs into filter
								because we found that these are not often used by users, and instead we put the timeline
								on top.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the filter, we added functions that sort messages based on the senders so that it is
								easier to locate a message from a certain sender. We also added a search function that
								if users have a target message they couldn’t find it.
							</p>
						</li>

					</ul>


					<!-- Second user testing -->
					<h1>Second round User Testing</h1>
					<p>After finishing the prototypes, we performed second round user testing to test our
						redesigned prototypes.</p>
					<ul id="canvas-task">
						<li>
							<h3>User testing plan</h3>
							<p>
								Testing procedures are similar to that of the first user testing, but 
								in this section, we asked users to do tasks related to using inbox page to test our redesigned component. 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p class="task">A: You just received a notification of a new message, find that
										message.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">B: Your professor sent a message a couple of weeks ago about
										an exam/assignment/lab that you are currently working on, find that message.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">C: Find the most recent message sent by your TA of a specific
										course.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="task">D:Your TA updates the zoom link for your discussion section, find
										the new link.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>User testing analysis</h3>
							<p>When redesigning the inbox page, we focused on making the contents more organized. We
								have done so by adding different categorizations that make the interactivity more
								flexible and efficient. In the second round of user testing, we found that some of the
								redesigned parts worked well while some did not work as expected.
							</p>
							<h5 style="font-size: large;">What did work</h5>
							<p>
								Categorizing the messages by courses increases the efficiency of use, and helps users
								when they are looking for a message. The course labels on the top (redesign 1) work well
								as they help users identify the messages. The timeline (redesign 2) also worked as it
								provided faster access to old messages. Also, The search function also helped users with
								finding specific messages and addressing them.
							</p>
							<img src="images/canvas/working1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/canvas/working2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/canvas/working3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
							<img src="images/canvas/working4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">


							<h5 style="font-size: large;">What did not work</h5>
							<p>
								The filter did not work as expected. We thought it would be helpful to have
								categorizations of messages so that users can filter out unwanted messages. However, it
								did not work as it increased the workflow for some users. Users would want to scroll
								rather than clicks a couple of times.
							</p>

							<img src="images/canvas/notworking3.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">

						</li>

					</ul>

					<!-- Reflection -->
					<h1>Reflection</h1>
					<p>From the user test on our redesigns, we figured that some problems we identified might not be a
						good representation of the problems for the population due to the limited number of users we
						have. While it can be easier for someone to locate messages using the filter, it’s true that for
						someone else using the filter increases their workflow. we noticed that in the 2nd user testing,
						some of our users rarely use inbox although they use the Canvas Student app. These users receive
						relatively little amount of messages from the professors or TAs at school and they thought the
						filter is unnecessary. We learned that there is always a tradeoff when making changes. When
						redesigning a component, we should test it thoroughly with enough users to make sure the
						tradeoff is worth it. </p>

					<p>Besides, we found that it could be difficult to select users to test redesigns since we have to
						consider people who are users or potential users of the app while at the same time they might
						already be familiar with the app. It is hard to test the redesigns when we don’t know whether
						the users’ reactions are due to the lack of effectiveness of our changes or simply because they
						were too familiar with the old versions.
